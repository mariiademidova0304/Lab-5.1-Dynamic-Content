# Reflection
1. Added elements using event listeners for buttons, then delegating them through the parent element.
2. I used dataset.price like the example in one of the functions to alter the total cost. I later added another dataset for the quantity parameter.
3. I set up alerts for invalid input. My price input is a number, so you can not type anything, but a number there - I've tried.
4. Remove function was already written for this in suggested code! But it did take me a while figure out how to access the changes made to the quantity that should affect the total price. Adding event to lines with multiple elements and when it's an input field seems to be trickier.
